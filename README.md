Sample English CV in OpenDocument format
========================================

This repository contains my English CV and some other CV-related documents.

They are free to use as an example of how to write a CV in English.

### andrea-cisternino-cv.odt

This is the main version I have used throughout 2011. It has a structure that
provide the key information in the first page but, at the same time, it is
fancier than what some recruiters believe is OK for a technical CV.

### andrea-cisternino-cv-simple.odt

This is a simpler 2-page CV with a more classical structure.

### andrea-cisternino-project-list.odt

This is list of the last few projects I was part of. Some recruiters asked for
it so here it is.

OTH.
